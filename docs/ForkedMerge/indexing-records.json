Return Value The final accumulated value. If the sequence has no elements, the result is initialResult. Discussion Use the reduce(_:_:) method to produce a single value from the elements of an entire sequence. For example, you can use this method on an array of numbers to find their sum or product. The nextPartialResult closure is called sequentially with an accumulating value initialized to initialResult and each element of the sequence. This example shows how to find the sum of an array of numbers.  When numbers.reduce(_:_:) is called, the following steps occur: The nextPartialResult closure is called with initialResult—0 in this case—and the first element of numbers, returning the sum: 1. The closure is called again repeatedly with the previous call’s return value and each element of the sequence. When the sequence is exhausted, the last value returned from the closure is returned to the caller. If the sequence has no elements, nextPartialResult is never executed and initialResult is the result of the call to reduce(_:_:).

The following examples show the effects of the maxSplits and omittingEmptySubsequences parameters when splitting a string using a closure that matches spaces. The first use of split returns each word that was originally separated by one or more spaces.  The second example passes 1 for the maxSplits parameter, so the original string is split just once, into two new strings.  The final example passes false for the omittingEmptySubsequences parameter, so the returned array contains empty strings where spaces were repeated.

A predicate that returns true if its first argument should be ordered before its second argument; otherwise, false. Return Value A sorted array of the sequence’s elements. Discussion When you want to sort a sequence of elements that don’t conform to the Comparable protocol, pass a predicate to this method that returns true when the first element should be ordered before the second. The elements of the resulting array are ordered according to the given predicate. In the following example, the predicate provides an ordering for an array of a custom HTTPResponse type. The predicate orders errors before successes and sorts the error responses by their error code.  You also use this method to sort elements that conform to the Comparable protocol in descending order. To sort your sequence in descending order, pass the greater-than operator (>) as the areInIncreasingOrder parameter.  Calling the related sorted() method is equivalent to calling this method and passing the less-than operator (<) as the predicate.  The predicate must be a strict weak ordering over the elements. That is, for any elements a, b, and c, the following conditions must hold: areInIncreasingOrder(a, a) is always false. (Irreflexivity) If areInIncreasingOrder(a, b) and areInIncreasingOrder(b, c) are both true, then areInIncreasingOrder(a, c) is also true. (Transitive comparability) Two elements are incomparable if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If a and b are incomparable, and b and c are incomparable, then a and c are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability) The sorting algorithm is guaranteed to be stable.
