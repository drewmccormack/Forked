The elements of the resulting array are ordered according to the given predicate. In the following example, the predicate provides an ordering for an array of a custom HTTPResponse type. The predicate orders errors before successes and sorts the error responses by their error code.  You also use this method to sort elements that conform to the Comparable protocol in descending order.
