The elements of the resulting array are ordered according to the given predicate. In the following example, the predicate provides an ordering for an array of a custom HTTPResponse type. The predicate orders errors before successes and sorts the error responses by their error code.  You also use this method to sort elements that conform to the Comparable protocol in descending order. To sort your sequence in descending order, pass the greater-than operator (>) as the areInIncreasingOrder parameter.  Calling the related sorted() method is equivalent to calling this method and passing the less-than operator (<) as the predicate.  The predicate must be a strict weak ordering over the elements.
