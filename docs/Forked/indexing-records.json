Overview ForkedCloudKit makes it easy to sync your Forked data between devices using Apple’s CloudKit framework. This guide will walk you through the basic setup and usage. Getting Started First, make sure you have the ForkedCloudKit subpackage added to your project dependencies. Then import ForkedCloudKit in your source files:  Basic Setup The main class you’ll work with is CloudKitExchange. Here’s how to set it up:  The id parameter should be a unique string that identifies this resource in CloudKit. How It Works CloudKitExchange automatically: Monitors changes to your ForkedResource’s main fork Uploads changes to iCloud when detected Downloads changes from other devices Before merging any changes, it checks the model version of the remote data and the local data. If the model version from iCloud is one that is unknown in the local app, it calls the unknownModelVersionHandler closure, and stops syncing. The user should update their app to the latest version. If the model is known, it merges the remote changes into your local data on the main fork All of this happens in the background without blocking your app’s UI. Model Versioning ForkedCloudKit requires your model to conform to VersionedModel to ensure safe syncing across different app versions. This is crucial because: Different versions of your app may have different data models When syncing, you need to ensure the app can understand the data it receives Older versions of your app should not try to merge data from newer, unknown model versions Here’s how to make your model versioned:  When you update your model in a new app version, increment the version by 1. If CloudKitExchange encounters data with an unknown version (higher than the version in the code): It calls your unknownModelVersionHandler closure Stops syncing to prevent data corruption The user should be prompted to update their app Example Implementation Here’s a complete example showing how to integrate CloudKit sync into a SwiftUI app:  CloudKit Setup in Xcode Before your app can use CloudKit: Enable iCloud in your Xcode target’s capabilities tab Choose or add a container (eg “iCloud.com.mycompany.myapp”). The container ID should match the id parameter in your CloudKitExchange initializer. Also enable the background modes for remote notifications and background processing Advanced Usage Custom Container By default, CloudKitExchange uses the default CloudKit container. You can specify a custom container:  Monitoring Sync Updates CloudKitExchange automatically handles sync in the background, but you can monitor when changes from CloudKit are merged into your main fork. To do this, add a Task on launch that monitors the changeStream for changes from CloudKit:  CloudKit Schema Setup Before your app can use CloudKit, you need to set up the schema. You could do this by running your app in development mode in Xcode, but if you do this, you are unlikely to trigger certain situations, such as when you have a very large file. For this reason, it is best to actively import the CloudKit schema used by Forked. Enable iCloud in your Xcode target’s capabilities tab Choose or add a container (eg “iCloud.com.mycompany.myapp”) Import the CloudKit schema file (cloudkit-schema.ckdb) into your development environment using the CloudKit Console (https:\/\/icloud.developer.apple.com) Deploy the schema to production before releasing your app The schema defines two Forked-related record types:  Important: You must deploy the schema to production before releasing your app. If you don’t, users won’t be able to sync their data. Managing File Assets with CloudKitAssets The CloudKitAssets class provides a simple way to manage file assets with CloudKit synchronization. It automatically handles: Storing files in CloudKit Syncing files across devices Splitting large files into parts (up to 250MB total) Soft deletion of files Basic Usage  Monitoring Changes You can monitor changes to assets using the changeStream property:  File Size Limits Individual files must be under 250MB Files over 50MB are automatically split into parts (up to 5 parts) The total size of all parts must not exceed 250MB Troubleshooting Common issues and solutions: No Sync: Ensure iCloud is enabled on the device, the user is signed in, and iCloud Drive enabled Data Not Appearing: Check that your CloudKit container is properly configured. No Sync in Production Version: Make sure you push your CloudKit schema to production before launching your app. Use the CloudKit web portal (https:\/\/icloud.developer.apple.com) to do this Conflicts: ForkedCloudKit automatically handles conflicts using your resource’s merge strategy Further Reading CloudKit Documentation Forked Documentation Sample App: Forking Simple iCloud","title":"CloudKit Integration Guide"},{"title":"load()","summary":"","location":{"reference":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Forked\/documentation\/Forked\/AtomicRepository\/load()"},"type":"topLevelPage"},"headings":[],"kind":"symbol","rawIndexableTextContent":" "},{"summary":"When an object is created for the first time, or saved, this version is set to the most recent version (currentModelVersion).

Overview Forked provides a safe way to handle shared data by allowing you to create independent branches (forks) of your data that can be modified concurrently and merged later. This guide will walk you through the basic concepts using practical examples. Creating Your First Resource The easiest way to get started is with QuickFork, which manages a single value in memory:  value(in:) returns an optional because the value might not exist in a given fork. When you’re sure the value exists (like right after creation), you can force unwrap with !. In production code, you might want to handle the optional more safely. Working with Forks Creating Named Forks While every resource has a .main fork, you’ll often want to create additional named forks. One convenient approach is to define your forks as static properties in an extension to Fork:  You can also create forks directly if you prefer:  Updating Values You can update values independently in different forks:  Merging Changes When you’re ready to reconcile changes between forks, you can merge them. All merges must go through the main fork - you cannot merge directly between custom forks:  Merging Direction Merging is directional - changes flow from the source fork to the destination fork. To fully synchronize two forks, you need to merge in both directions:  For convenience, there’s a syncMain(with:) method that performs bidirectional merges between main and multiple forks:  Remember that syncing between custom forks still requires going through main. The sync method makes this easier by handling all the necessary merges in each direction. Working with Complex Types While the examples above use simple Int values, Forked really shines when working with complex types.

Centralized vs Decentralized The Traditional Approach Applications traditionally use a centralized approach to manage shared data. At the heart of this approach lies a central coordinator, such as a lock, queue, or actor, which protects the shared resource, providing serial access to it. While this pattern is familiar, it comes with significant drawbacks. Changes must be synchronized through the coordinator, forcing other parts of the system to wait while changes occur. This not only creates bottlenecks and synchronization costs but also makes it challenging to reason about the system’s state, often leading to subtle race conditions. The Decentralized Way Forked takes inspiration from proven distributed version control systems like Git. With these systems, changes flow more naturally. Developers can work independently, without waiting to coordinate with other developers. When conflicts arise, the system has a complete picture of what’s changed through its history tracking. This philosophy translates directly to how Forked operates in your application. You’re free to modify data without considering other subsystems or devices, and reconciliation happens later through well-defined merge policies. The key innovation is Forked’s support for 3-way merging, where a historical “common ancestor” helps determine exactly what’s changed in each fork when a conflict arises. The Reality of Modern Apps Most modern applications are inherently decentralized, whether intentional or not. Consider how your app might sync data across multiple devices, or how app extensions operate in separate processes on shared data. Even background processes performing imports or downloads from a web service must coordinate with the main app. These scenarios all represent decentralized operations, even if we often try to force them into a centralized model. Sync Comes for Free Forked’s decentralized approach means that sync is a natural part of the system. By providing some limited history tracking, in the form of a common ancestor, as well a powerful merging, you can begin developing an app for a single device, and very simply add support for sync with no model changes, and no custom server. Just connect iCloud, and you’re done. Forked and Actor-Based Systems While actors excel at preventing data races through controlled access to shared resources, they can’t prevent higher-level race conditions or solve the complexities of reentrant code and interleaved operations. This is where Forked steps up, complementing actor-based architectures by providing robust conflict management capabilities. Architectural Components The Forked Hub Rather than implementing a full version control system, Forked maintains just enough history for effective 3-way merging, keeping memory usage low. In optimal cases, the size of a ForkedResource is practically the same as the size of the resource it contains. In a ForkedResource, forks are arranged in a hub-and-spoke pattern. The hub is the main fork, while other forks (the spokes) can merge with the main fork, but not directly with each other.  The main fork in the hub stores exactly one copy of the resource — its current value. Other forks, on the other hand, are responsible for keeping track of the common ancestor when updates occur. In this way, a 3-way merge between the main fork and any other fork can be performed at any time. The non-main forks can contain various copies of the resource, based on their relationship to the main fork: When a fork is in sync with the main fork, it stores no additional copies of the resource When the main fork has progressed ahead, the fork retains only the common ancestor copy When the fork conflicts with the main fork, it maintains two copies: the common ancestor and its own most recent value Whenever an update to any fork is made, copies of the resource into forks can arise. For example, take the simple case that all forks are in sync. If an update occurs to the main fork, a copy of the resource is made into all of the non-main forks, because they all need a common ancestor to perform a 3-way merge in future. Later, if the main fork gets fully synced with one of the other forks, that fork will no longer have any copy of the resource. This careful management of state means that: The minimum necessary history is preserved in order to facilitate 3-way merges When all forks are in sync, only one copy of the resource exists in memory Memory usage scales with the number of conflicts, not with the number of forks The spoked architecture keeps the number of common ancestors low, because they aren’t needed for every single pair of forks"},{"location":{"reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/Forked\/documentation\/Forked\/forkedAPIVersion","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"type":"topLevelPage"},"summary":"The version of the Forked API.

Overview Forked provides a comprehensive solution for managing concurrent data access and synchronization through a Git-inspired branching and merging system. Instead of using traditional concurrency primitives like locks or actors, Forked allows you to safely work with multiple copies of data and merge them systematically. Key Concepts Forks A fork represents a branch of your data that can be modified independently of other branches. Every ForkedResource has a main fork, and you can create additional named forks for different purposes like UI updates, background processing, or network synchronization. Resources A ForkedResource manages the state and history of your data across multiple forks. It tracks changes, maintains the common ancestor states needed for merging, and provides methods for updating and querying values in different forks. Merging When forks diverge and need to be reconciled, Forked provides sophisticated merging capabilities. The framework supports both automatic merging for simple types and custom merge strategies for complex data structures. Repositories A ForkedResource does not actually store any data: it just contains the logic for managing forks and resources. Repositories provide the storage for a ForkedResource, whether it be in memory, on disk, in a database, or in the cloud.","kind":"symbol","summary":"A framework for handling shared data with confidence in Swift."},{"title":"Equatable Implementations","location":{"reference":{"url":"doc:\/\/Forked\/documentation\/Forked\/Version\/Equatable-Implementations","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"type":"topLevelPage"},"kind":"article","summary":"","headings":[],"rawIndexableTextContent":""}]
